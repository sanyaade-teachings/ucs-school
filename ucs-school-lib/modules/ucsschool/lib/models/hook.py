    Base class for all (1) Python based hooks for ucsschool.lib.model classes
    derived from UCSSchoolHelperAbstractClass.

    The :py:attr:`model` attribute must be set to the class object the hook is
    intended for.

    Examples are provided in /usr/share/doc/ucs-school-lib-common/hook_example*.py

    The following attributes are available:

    * self.lo        # LDAP connection object
    * self.logger    # Python logging instance
    * self.ucr       # UCR instance

    If multiple hook classes are found, hook methods with higher priority
    numbers run before those with lower priorities. None disables a method (no
    need to remove it or comment it out).

    (1) While it also works for :py:class:`ucsschool.importer.models.import_user.ImportUser`,
    it is strongly recommended to use the dedicated hook class
    :py:class:`ucsschool.importer.utils.user_pyhook.UserPyHook` for it. It adds
    attributes that are useful in the user import context.
